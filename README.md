# Homework 12 Employee_Tracker
# GitHub Repository: https://github.com/akorjeski/Employee_Tracker


A command-line application that allows the user to:
1. Add departments, roles, employees
2. View departments, roles, employees    
3. Update employee roles


```
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
```

## How it works
* Navigate to the file structure and run __node app.js__
* You will now have to choose between the options presented to you.
* If you select __"Update Employee Role"__, it has to be a role that exists!! Otherwise it errors out and tells you! (Hint, make one and then add it to an employee)
